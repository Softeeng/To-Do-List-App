## To-Do List Console App

---

A simple command-line-to-do list manager built with Python. Part of my 6-month game and software development learning journey.

---

## Features
- Add new tasks with descriptions
- Edit existing task descriptions
- Delete tasks with confirmation
- Mark tasks as done/undone
- Automatic save/load functionality (persists between sessions)
- View all tasks with status and creation timestamps

---

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- No external dependencies (uses only standard library)

---

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Softeeng/To-Do-List-App
cd todo-list-app
```
2. Run the application
```bash
python todo_list.py
```

---

## Usage
The app presents a menu-driven interface:
1. View all tasks - Display your complete task list
2. Add a task - Create a new task
3. Edit a task - Modify an existing task description
4. Delete a task - Remove a task permanently
5. Mark task as done - Complete a task
6. Mark task as undone - Reopen a completed task
7. Exit - Close the application

All tasks are automatically saved to tasks.json in the same directory

## Project Structure
todo-list-app/

│── todo_list.py     # Main application file 

|── tasks.json       # Auto-generated date file (not tracked in git) 

│── README.md        # This file 

│── .gitignore       # Git ignore rules

## Learning Objectives
This project helped me practice:
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) with classes
- File I/O operations (reading/writing JSON)
- Data structures (lists and dictionaries)
- Error handling and input validation
- User interface design for console applications

---

## Future Enhancements
Potential features to add:
- Task priorities (high, medium, low)
- Due dates and reminders
- Categories/tags for organizing tasks
- Search and filter functionality
- Statistics (completed vs pending tasks)

---

## Roadmap Context
This is completing Month 1 of my [6-Month Game & Software Dev Project Roadmap](https://github.com/Softeeng/6-Month-Roadmap/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file)

**Month 1 Goal:** Build a console-based To-Do-List App with full CRUD operations and file persistence.
